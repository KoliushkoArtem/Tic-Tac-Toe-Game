# Tic Tac Toe Game Center
## The aim of the project is to create an application to play Tic Tac Toe with a different types of games:<br>
### • Player versus Player
### • Player versus Random
(the program steps is determined by the method of randomizing of empty spaces on the game field)
### • Player versus the MiniMax Algorithm
(the program steps is determined by artificial intelligence by the method of minimizing the maximum possible losses,
which does not give the player a chance to win)<br>
All results of games with the algorithm are saved to the database and are
displayed on the main page of the application and after the game with the
MiniMax Algorithm is finished.
## The project uses:<br>
### • Java<br>
### • Maven<br>
### • Spring Boot<br>
### • Hibernate<br>
### • MySQL<br>
### • Javadoc<br>
### • Three-tier architecture<br>
### • Project Lombok<br>
### • Junit/Mockito<br>
### • Continuous integration tools(JaCoCo/Codecov/Travis CI)<br>
